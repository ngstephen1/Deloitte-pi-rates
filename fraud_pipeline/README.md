# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection Pipeline

A practical, modular unsupervised anomaly detection pipeline for fraud/anomaly identification in banking transactions. **Implements Steps 1-8: from data ingestion through interactive analyst review.**

## Overview

This pipeline processes Kaggle's Bank Transaction Dataset (2,512 transactions) through 8 complete steps:

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Normalize dates, engineer features, handle anomalies
2. **EDA & Profiling**: Summary statistics, Benford's Law, visualizations
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest, LOF, K-Means clustering
4. **TDA Analysis**: Topological Data Analysis (stub for future enhancement)
5. **Graph Analysis**: Transaction graph with NetworkX, suspicious patterns
6. **Risk Scoring**: Composite transparent scoring from all signals
7. **Reporting & Visualizations**: Dashboards, summaries, optional OpenAI explanations
8. **Streamlit App**: Interactive analyst review and approval workflow

## Key Features

- **Unsupervised approach**: No fraud labels assumed; focus on statistical anomalies
- **Modular design**: Each stage is independent and reusable
- **Transparent scoring**: All weights in `config.py` for easy tuning
- **Production-ready**: Defensive programming, clear function boundaries, logging
- **Tableau-ready outputs**: All results exported as CSV
- **Interactive executive demo**: Streamlit dashboard with polished KPI cards, filters, charts, and analyst workflow
- **CSV upload workflow**: Users can choose a CSV type, validate it, preview it, and analyze raw uploads directly in Streamlit
- **Optional AI features**: Live recommendations, Q&A, and case explanations powered by `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **OpenClaw-style ChatOps**: Discord webhook delivery, fraud alerting, proactive reminders, and grounded analyst Q&A against the latest fraud context
- **Persistent review log**: Analyst decisions are stored in a lightweight CSV log with timestamps and versioned updates
- **Lightweight**: Runs in ~40 seconds on standard laptop; <500MB memory

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection)
- **Size**: 2,512 transactions
- **Columns**: 16 features (TransactionID, AccountID, Amount, Date, Type, Location, Device, IP, Merchant, Channel, Age, Occupation, Duration, LoginAttempts, Balance, PreviousTransactionDate)

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. (Optional) Enable AI Features With OPENAI_API_KEY

The app runs without AI. If you want live recommendations, live Q&A, and AI case explanations, export your API key before launching Streamlit:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENCLAW_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.4"
export OPENCLAW_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT="medium"
```

AI behavior is controlled in `src/config.py`:

```python
ENABLE_AI_FEATURES = True
USE_OPENAI_EXPLANATIONS = False
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-5-mini"
```

- `ENABLE_AI_FEATURES` controls live Streamlit AI features.
- `USE_OPENAI_EXPLANATIONS` controls pipeline-time explanation generation into `outputs/reports/openai_explanations.json`.
- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing, the app keeps working and shows graceful fallback messaging.
- The ChatOps bridge reuses `OPENAI_API_KEY` and can use its own GPT-5.4 override through `OPENCLAW_OPENAI_MODEL`.

### 3. Run Backend Pipeline (Steps 1-7)

```bash
# Run full pipeline: ingest → EDA → anomaly detection → graph → risk scoring → reporting
python3 run_pipeline.py

# This will:
# - Process raw CSV and engineer features
# - Run anomaly detection (IF, LOF, K-Means)
# - Compute graph-based risk metrics
# - Combine into composite risk score
# - Generate visualizations (Plotly HTML)
# - Create CSV exports for Tableau
# - Generate executive summary
# Output: ~40 seconds, creates files in outputs/
```

### 4. Launch Interactive Streamlit App (Step 8)

```bash
# After pipeline completes, launch the fraud intelligence dashboard
python3 -m streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

# Opens at http://localhost:8501
# Features:
#  - Executive summary dashboard
#  - CSV upload workflow with type selection and validation
#  - Filter suspicious transactions by risk level, account, merchant, and channel
#  - View risk component breakdown (IF, LOF, K-Means, graph)
#  - Generate AI recommendations and ask live questions about the active dataset
#  - Generate AI case explanations for transactions, accounts, merchants, and locations
#  - Record analyst decisions (Approve Flag / Dismiss / Needs Review)
#  - Persist and export review log
#  - Publish the active fraud context for Discord/OpenClaw and optionally send report digests or alerts
```

### 5. Upload CSV Files Directly In Streamlit

Inside the app:

1. Open the `Upload Data` section.
2. Choose the CSV type first:
   - `Raw transaction dataset`
   - `Processed / scored transaction dataset`
   - `Analyst review log`
3. Upload the file.
4. Review the preview, detected columns, row count, and validation result.
5. Click `Run Fraud Analysis` for raw transaction uploads or `Load Uploaded File` for the other preset types.

For raw uploads, the app runs the existing cleaning, anomaly detection, graph analysis, and risk scoring logic in memory without overwriting your saved pipeline outputs. After a valid file is processed, the app publishes the latest fraud context into `outputs/chatops/active_context/`, attempts a ChatOps delivery when configured, and shows the toast `Fraud Analysis Report Sent to Chat`.

### 6. OpenClaw / Discord ChatOps

The Streamlit dashboard remains the main fraud workspace. The ChatOps layer complements it by:

- publishing the latest active fraud context from Streamlit or saved outputs
- sending report digests and threshold-based alerts to Discord via webhook
- supporting grounded analyst Q&A from the latest published fraud context
- sending proactive monitoring reminders while the Discord companion bot is running

Common environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENCLAW_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.4"
export OPENCLAW_OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT="medium"
export OPENCLAW_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
export OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_FORMAT="discord"
export OPENCLAW_STREAMLIT_AUTO_SEND="true"
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="..."
export DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS="1482399372724539568"
export DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS="1482399372099452982"
export OPENCLAW_DISCORD_PROACTIVE_ENABLED="true"
export OPENCLAW_DISCORD_PROACTIVE_CHANNEL_IDS="1482485873265213571"
export DISCORD_REPLY_ONLY_ON_MENTION="false"
```

Manual ChatOps commands:

```bash
# Preview the report and alert payloads without sending them
python3 scripts/send_fraud_alerts.py --dry-run

# Send the latest report digest and any active threshold-based alerts
python3 scripts/send_fraud_alerts.py

# Ignore alert dedupe state for a manual live demo run
python3 scripts/send_fraud_alerts.py --force

# Ask a grounded analyst question locally against the latest active ChatOps context
python3 scripts/test_openclaw_chatops.py --question "What are the top 5 suspicious accounts?"

# Ask against saved pipeline outputs instead of the last published Streamlit context
python3 scripts/test_openclaw_chatops.py --use-pipeline-outputs --question "Show me high-risk items still pending analyst review."

# Run the Discord companion bot for live analyst back-and-forth and proactive reminders
python3 scripts/openclaw_discord_bot.py
```

## Configuration

All tunable parameters are in `src/config.py`:

```python
# Risk scoring weights (sum to 1.0)
RISK_WEIGHTS = {
    "isolation_forest_score": 0.25,
    "lof_score": 0.20,
    "kmeans_anomaly_score": 0.15,
    "graph_risk_score": 0.15,
    "login_attempt_risk": 0.10,
    "amount_outlier_risk": 0.10,
    "previous_date_regenerated": 0.05,
}

# Anomaly detection thresholds
ISOLATION_FOREST_CONTAMINATION = 0.05
LOF_N_NEIGHBORS = 20
KMEANS_N_CLUSTERS = 10

# Risk level thresholds
RISK_LEVEL_LOW = 0.33
RISK_LEVEL_MEDIUM = 0.66
RISK_LEVEL_HIGH = 1.0

# Enable OpenAI explanations (requires OPENAI_API_KEY env var)
USE_OPENAI_EXPLANATIONS = False  # Set to True to enable
```

Adjust these values and re-run `python run_pipeline.py` to see impact.

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

### Handling PreviousTransactionDate Issue

Raw data has future dates (2024) relative to transaction dates (2023). Solution:
- Detect unrealistic dates (configurable threshold)
- Regenerate synthetic previous dates with random intervals (1-180 days before current transaction)
- Add flag column `previous_date_regenerated` for tracking
- Documented in logs

### Engineered Features (8 total)

1. **time_since_previous_transaction**: Days between transactions
2. **transaction_amount_to_balance_ratio**: Amount as % of balance
3. **login_attempt_risk**: Normalized login attempts
4. **device_change_flag**: First device for account?
5. **ip_change_flag**: First IP for account?
6. **account_transaction_count**: Total transactions per account
7. **merchant_transaction_count**: Total transactions per merchant
8. **location_transaction_count**: Total transactions per location

## Anomaly Detection Methods

- **Isolation Forest** (0.25 weight): Tree-based outlier isolation
- **Local Outlier Factor** (0.20 weight): Density-based detection
- **K-Means** (0.15 weight): Identify small/unusual clusters
- **Graph Features** (0.15 weight): Network-based suspicious patterns (degree, centrality, component size)

All normalized to [0, 1]; combined via weighted average.

```

## Performance

- **Runtime**: ~40 seconds for 2,512 transactions (standard laptop)
- **Memory**: <500MB peak usage
- **Scalability**: Tested up to 100K transactions

## Assumptions & Design Choices

1. **Unsupervised learning**: No fraud labels in dataset; rely on statistical anomalies
2. **Synthetic dates**: PreviousTransactionDate issue documented and handled automatically
3. **Simple TDA**: Kept minimal to avoid dependency bloat; can enhance later
4. **Transparent scoring**: All weights visible and configurable, not a black box
5. **CSV-first**: All outputs as CSV for Tableau/BI tool compatibility
6. **Optional OpenAI**: Works without API key; graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements

- Supervised classification if fraud labels available
- Graph Neural Networks for learned embeddings
- Full TDA visualization (KeplerMapper, Ripser)
- Time-series anomaly detection (LSTM/Prophet)
- Real-time scoring API
- Batch job scheduler for production deployment
